drive service leaf something desired order wrong lady grumpy
place continues joke service bad attitude worker worse order never right yet still never officially deem place worst restaurant pittsburgh
worst service dirty slow ignorant strictest definition bad real bad
food delicious staff prompt one thing absolutely love restaurant clean bathroom completely stunned amazed walked
shop pretty great location cute decor accept cash annoying friendliness staff varies significantly awesome terrible could deal either given love coffee shop guess need consistency want know expect know coffee pretty good awesome certainly drinkable pastry vary bit well offer carrot cake cupcake pretty cool think something wrong fridge making thing stale half time kind meh note outdoor seating really good unless smoke one employee spends half day smoking
place smell awful non smoking reek stale smoke spend hour leave smelling like smoke isn isolated incident really smell every time least month past couple year side decent coffee decent assorted snack pastry sandwich etc great location
really want see small coffee shop succeed regent square full small business community really supportive believe lack coffee chain reason still open cash half business street hold dingy use space well coffee brewed poured regular old coffee pump pot dessert looked good one lonely cookie two cupcake granted saturday night looked really sparse
depressing coffee shop went wednesday afternoon find place dim muggy eerily silent music talk shuffling noise filled sense sadness tried sit enjoy coffee drinkable couldn get odd atmosphere music started quiet couldn even tell giving two star awesome alternative energy poster hanging far wall
regent square nice little area certainly deserves better coffee shop katerbean moved pittsburgh july got interwebs home would frequent katerbean fairly regularly least time per week order use free drink every time every time went left reeking smoke smoking inside course always happened maybe due poor ventilation fact employee regularly outside smoking always left smelling like bar table usually dirty would order drink would usually get napkin wet wipe table surprising employee encountered exception nice older woman seemed pretty put asked anything case internet access home haven back katerbean since guess really thing place going
yeah agree general consensus katerbean one day going write anonymous note include copy review think owner mean harm leaving wall painted sherbet orange sans artwork may need guidance yes place smell good carpet scrubbing would work tearing would much better coffee step foldgers soy milk taste like whole milk table often dirty little bit interior design education change management could make place totally rock especially root 176 regent theater right street regent square cry good coffee shop could one hopefully someday keeping finger toe crossed
inattentive staff dirty table agree review think manager hire smoker spend time sitting outside smoking instead prepared serve customer sometimes convenient location last week left broken week degree weather additional fan nothing fixed went ordered coffee order hummus carrot celery prepackaged hummus watery sitting container several day celery rotting end yes brown rotting showed kid working probably jonesing next cigarette asked another one without opening could see least serving hummus also watery celery starting rot like one given asked money back know worst thing though kid know nothing customer service let alone food service put container watery rotting celery back case serve unsuspecting customer hello allegheny county health department ultimate insult kid came selling candy bar seen time said know business shouldn well older girl probably mother put hand hip said smart tone asked owner allowed well coffee spent last money spend place disgusting
